If you do a git clone and you know the repository you are cloning should ask for username and password but it doesn't and you are on a Windows PC, you may need to review your Generic Credentials in the Crendential Manager found in the Control Panel.

For my situation I just deleted the Generic Credential for my git and when I tried cloning again in Git Bash I got the prompts for my credentials.
